GENERAL INFORMATION

Project Name: Stat159-Fall2016-Project1

Author: Erica Wong

Description:

I am currently a student in Stat 159 at UC Berkeley. In this project, I am going to describe the computational tools that we have learned about so far in class. Additionally, this project will test how well I know how to use the tools that I am decribing. 

Organization:

* Images: This folder contains all the different images that are used in my markdown files.
* Makefile: This contains information on how to put together the different sections of my paper into one html file and contains a clean phony target that removes the html file.
* Paper: This file contains the different sections of my paper inside the folder entitled sections. Addtionally, it contains my final write up in both markdown and html format.
