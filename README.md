##GENERAL INFORMATION

Project Name: Stat159-Fall2016-Project1

Author: Erica Wong

Description:

I am currently a student in Stat 159 at UC Berkeley. In this project, I am going to describe the computational tools that we have learned about so far in class. Specifically, I will comment on how I used these different tools in the process of creating this project. Additionally, this project will test how well I know how to use the tools that I am describing. 

Organization:

* .gitignore: In the .gitignore file, we would put files and directories that we want to ignore in Git. In this project, we want everything so .gitignore should be empty.
* Images: This folder contains all the different images that are used in my markdown files.
* Makefile: This contains information on how to put together the different sections of my paper into one html file using Pandoc and contains a clean phony target that removes the html file.
* Paper: This file contains the different sections of my paper inside the folder entitled sections. The different sections are the abstract, introduction, discussion and conclusion. Additionally, it contains my final write up in both markdown and html format.
