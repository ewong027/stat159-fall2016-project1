## Conclusion

### Experience with Project

My overall experience in working with this project is positive. I found some of the easiest parts to be describing the tools. This is because I have been working with these tools for a couple of weeks now, so it is much easier to write about the function of each of them after having experience with working with them myself. The most challenging part of this project, and the part that I was stuck on was creating the Makefile. This is because Makefile is one of the more recent topics that we have learned about, so understanding how it worked was a process of trial and error. Additionally, making sure that my Markdown files were in the correct format was something that I found to be challenging. This is because I have never written so much text in a Markdown file before, so getting used to the formatting is something that I needed to get used to. Writing everything in the Markdown file was also the part that I found to be the most time consuming in this project. However, this was to be expected the main product that is being made from this project is a paper. I did not work with anyone else on this project and overall this project took me about 5 hours to work on and edit.

### Concluding Thoughts

There are many tools that make creating reproducible data a lot easier. Makefile, Git, Github, Pandoc, and Markdown are just a few of the tools that can be used. Additionally, all of these tools reduce the dependency of one machine and allow for easy collaboration. The purpose of this project is to ensure that I know what each of these tools do and how they are used in a project. It is important to have a strong foundation and knowledge of what tools I am using because it allows for efficiency when using them and so that when I want to describe the benefits of reproducible data and these tools to others I can in an efficient manner. Finally, this project now creates a tool that others can use when they are trying to figure out what kinds of tools they can use to when trying to create reproducible data.
