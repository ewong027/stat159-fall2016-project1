## Abstract   

In this report, I am going to talk about the different the different computational tools that we learned about during the first couple of weeks of classes. Additionally, this paper is going to discuss how I used these tools when creating this project and my overall feelings about the process of creating this project. There are many different tools that are used in reproducible data. In our class so far, we have covered many things such as markdown, pandoc, git, github, Makefile, and how to use a text editor. So, through this report, we will discuss many of those topics and their uses.
