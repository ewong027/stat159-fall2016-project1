## Introduction

Reproducible data is a concept that is still relatively new to the world of data science. It is also something that people are still learning how to do. Using computational tools allows one to produce reproducible data much more efficiently, however, one must really understand the how to use those computational tools efficiently and properly before one is able to produce good reproducible data. That is why we are doing this project. The purpose of this project is to show our understanding of the tools that we have learned about in class. Additionally, by explaining what each of the tools are, if other were looking for a resource that would explain what some useful tools are for creating reproducible data, they could use this project to help them understand the tools better. 
This project discusses the tools Makefile, Markdown, Pandoc, Git, and Github. After that, I will talk about how I used these tools to create this project and my overall experience with working with these tools on this project. For example, I will answer questions such as what were what was the easiest and hardest part for me, what did I get stuck on and etc.
